# PhoneGap

### Introduction

PhoneGap is an open source and free framework (with some optional priced tools) enabling the creation of mobile apps across platforms using standard web APIs (HTML, CSS, Javascript). In other words, rather than requring multiple teams or development cycles to produce a iOS version of the app with Objective C, an Android version with Java, and maybe a Windows version with XAML and C#, the process may be streamilined with the bulk of the codebase for all apps developed within the same languages. (Of course not all of the code can remain the same for each version of the app, but we will get to that.)

### Advantages (Why Should We Care?)
1. Most importantly, PhoneGap shortens the development cycle for cross-platform mobile apps. Rather than developing two (or more) versions of the same app, the majority of code may remain the same across platforms.
2. There are less languages to learn and many programmers including less-experienced programmers already have experience building website. PhoneGap makes app development much more accessible to new programmers and small teams.

### Quick Note on Possible Point of Confusion
You may notice that much of the PhoneGap documentation points to a platform called [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) . What's the deal?

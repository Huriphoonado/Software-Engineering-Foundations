## PhoneGap

### Introduction

PhoneGap is an open source and free framework (with some optional priced tools) enabling the creation of mobile apps across platforms using standard web APIs (HTML, CSS, Javascript). In other words, rather than requring multiple teams or development cycles to produce a iOS version of the app with Objective C, an Android version with Java, and maybe a Windows version with XAML and C#, the process may be streamilined with the bulk of the codebase for all apps developed within the same languages. (Of course not all of the code can remain the same for each version of the app, but we will get to that.)
